# Custom divide/modulo function.

### In this project, a custom function/script which can be used to calculate the quotient and remainder of a dividend and a divisor is created.

### Example usage:

1. As a function:

```python
from div_mod_pkg import div_mod
quotient, remainder = div_mod(10, 3)
```

2. As a script:

```bash
div_mod_script.py 10 3
```
